# Spiced_Academy_SocialNetwork

## the Project:

The Social Network App is a single page application built with React.js, Socket.io, and Redux. This app allows users to register and log in, providing them with access to a range of features to enhance their social experience. Users can update their profile picture and biography to personalize their account.

One of the main features of the app is the ability to send and receive friend requests, which users can accept or reject. This feature allows users to expand their social network and connect with new people. Additionally, the app offers a search function to help users find new friends.

Another key feature of the app is the real-time chatroom. Users can communicate with each other through the chatroom, with the app keeping live track of who is actively chatting. This feature creates a dynamic and interactive social environment for users to engage with each other.

Overall, the Social Network App offers a comprehensive set of features that allow users to connect and communicate with each other in real-time. 

## Technologies used:

The Social Network App was built using a variety of modern technologies, including:
-   HTML5 and CSS3 for building the user interface and styling the application.

-   React.js for building the user interface components and enabling the app's dynamic behavior.

-   Redux for managing the app's state and enabling the implementation of complex features, such as real-time chat and friend requests.

-   Node.Js and Express.Js for building the server-side logic and enabling communication between the front-end and back-end.

-   PostgresSQL for storing and retrieving data from a relational database.

-   Webpack for bundling and optimizing the app's code for deployment.

-   Babel for transpiling modern JavaScript code into browser-compatible code.
